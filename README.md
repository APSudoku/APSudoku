## The Project
GodotAP is a Godot project designed to be re-used in other Godot projects for [Archipelago Randomizer](archipelago.gg). It contains a basic implementation to handle the various network communications used by Archipelago, and a custom console that can be used for command input and to display messages from the server (in rich-text format, with tooltips)

## CommonClient
Running the project itself will produce just the basic console, designed as an alternative to the Archipelago Text Client (and a base for custom clients to be built from).

## How To Use
Currently heavily WIP. Feel free to use what's here to build from, though nothing is "stable" as far as my development at the moment; everything is subject to change.
